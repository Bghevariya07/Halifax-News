					<img src="img/education.jpg" alt="education in canada">
					<p>While we may all be operating under the assumption that teaching has quickly transformed into online teaching during this pandemic and that this mode of teaching has not always been the most effective, it may be because of a few different reasons: (a) we are still in the middle of a pandemic and our daily stresses from this experience impact how we experience various things, including classes; (b) this mode of teaching requires additional training, infrastructure and support, and (c) this is still remote teaching in the middle of a pandemic and changes to courses are possible in small increments.</p>
					<p>This can lead to frustration among students and helplessness among teachers. In this opinion piece, Grogu writes about the <a class="links" href="#" target="_self">differences between online teaching and emergency remote teaching during a pandemic,</a>and discusses lessons we can take away from our collective experience.</p>

				<img src="img/health.jpeg" alt="health awareness">
				<p>Masks are useful, mainly because while we may not be symptomatic ourselves, we may still be carrying the coronavirus and unknowingly give it to others. This is an important aspect to remember now that vaccinations are underway, because even after you are vaccinated, you should continue to wear a mask until a large majority of the population has been vaccinated.</p> 
				<p>Follow public health guidelines, physical distance and wear a mask when you’re outside. Remember, we’re all in the same storm but not on the same boat: how this pandemic impacts each of us is very different depending on our individual differences. Let’s honour and respect these differences and support each other. Wear a mask.</p>
